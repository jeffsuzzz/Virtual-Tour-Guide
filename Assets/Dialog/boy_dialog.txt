Can you repeat it?,What did your mother say?,What about your father?,What next?
(Oh, hello! Are you here for my mother? No? Well you must be here for my practice class! I’m a little shy at school and mother wants me to practice talking with others. I talk with my older sisters, but girls don’t go to town schools or academies, so we don’t talk about the same things. Mother says I can practice by teaching, but I’m killing two birds with one stone. I’m going to practice and you can help me with my chores!)
(Mother says because I’m only eight I have to stay healthy for school, so I can’t work with the farm tools, but that does not stop her from giving me things to do. Today she wants me to preserve all of these cherries, and you can help me! I’ll show you how. Mother says it’s much easier to can cherries now with these mason jars, but I still think it’s hard work. At least I get to eat while I work!)
(My father used to love my mother’s cherries. He passed away not too long ago… I really miss him… He was such an intelligent man. He started his own school, you know! Eastman Commercial College, right here in Rochester. Have you heard of it? Sometimes I think if I study hard enough and stay in school, I’ll be able to go there someday. Mother says not to get my hopes up, but I don’t care.)
(Now that father is gone, I’m the man of the house. That means I have to help mother with chores like this. Even though it takes a long time to pit all of these cherries, I still do it. I’m in charge of taking care of the family now, and I’m going to help as much as I can.)
